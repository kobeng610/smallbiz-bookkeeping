## ✨ What Was Added
- Beautiful login screen with gradient background
- Password protection on app access
- "Remember me" option to stay logged in

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Upload These 3 Files to GitHub:
1. **index.html** - Has login screen
2. **css/styles.css** - Has login styles
3. **js/app.js** - Has authentication logic

### Steps:
1. Go to GitHub repo
2. Edit each file (click pencil icon)
3. Copy/paste new content
4. Commit changes
5. Netlify auto-deploys
6. Visit site - you'll see login! 🔒

## 🎯 How It Works

**First Visit:**
- User sees login screen
- Enters password: `MySecretPass123`
- Checks "Remember me" (optional)
- Gets access to app

**Return Visits:**
- If "Remember me" was checked → Goes straight in
- If not → Must login again

**Logout:**
- Click "Logout" in nav
- Returns to login screen
- Clears authentication

## 🔄 Change Password Later

In `js/app.js`, find line ~18:
```javascript
return password === 'MySecretPass123';
```
Change to your new password and upload!
