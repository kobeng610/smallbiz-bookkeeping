## 🎯 Overview

Your bookkeeping app now has **enterprise-grade license protection** that prevents sharing!

## 🔑 How It Works

### **For Each Sale:**
1. Generate unique license key
2. Add key to your code
3. Send key to buyer
4. They activate on their device
5. **Key locked to that device forever**

### **Anti-Sharing Protection:**

- If they try on another device → "Already activated elsewhere"
- Sharing is **impossible**

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Add License System to Your App**

Replace this line in `index.html` (before closing `</body>` tag):

**Find:**
```html
<script src="js/app.js"></script>
```

**Replace with:**
```html
<script src="js/license-auth.js"></script>
<script src="js/app.js"></script>
```

### **Step 2: Update Your Files**

Upload these new files to GitHub:
1. **js/license-auth.js** (download above)
2. **license-generator.html** (download above - keep private!)

## 🎫 Generating License Keys

### **Option 1: Use License Generator Tool**

1. Open `license-generator.html` locally (double-click it)
2. Enter buyer name
3. Click "Generate License Key"
4. Copy the generated code
5. Add to `js/license-auth.js`

### **Option 2: Manual Format**

License keys must be: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`
- 16 characters total (4 groups of 4)
- Use: A-Z and 0-9 only
- Must be unique

USER-1234-TEST-9999
```

## 📝 Adding New License Keys

### **In `js/license-auth.js` file:**

    activated: false, 
    deviceId: null, 
    activatedAt: null, 
    buyer: 'Demo User' 
  },

## 🛠️ Management

### **View Active Licenses:**

In `js/license-auth.js`, check the `validLicenses` object:

```javascript
'JOHN-DOE-2024-SALE': {
  activated: true,                    // ← Activated
  deviceId: '7a3f8b2c...',           // ← Device hash
  activatedAt: '2026-02-04T10:30:00Z', // ← When
  buyer: 'John Doe'                   // ← Who
},
```

### **Revoke a License:**

Change `activated` to `false` and set `deviceId` to `null`:

```javascript
'STOLEN-KEY-1234-5678': {
  activated: false,  // ← Revoked!
  deviceId: null,
  activatedAt: null,
  buyer: 'Revoked - Refund'
},
```

## 🔄 Buyer Experience

6. Can use forever on that device

### **Return Visits:**

## ❓ Common Questions

### **Q: What if buyer gets new computer?**
**A:** They need to contact you. You manually revoke old device, they can reactivate.

### **Q: Can they use on phone AND computer?**
**A:** No. One license = one device. Sell business license for multiple devices.

### **Q: What if they clear browser data?**
**A:** Device fingerprint stays same. License works fine.

### **Q: Can they screenshot and share the key?**
**A:** Key is useless - already bound to original device.

### **Q: Is this hackable?**
**A:** Client-side has limits, but device binding makes sharing impractical. For bank-level security, upgrade to server-based auth.
